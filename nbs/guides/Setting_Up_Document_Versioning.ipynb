    "Enabling document versioning in Material for nbdev is easy. Just add the `docs_versioning` flag to your `settings.ini` file with one of the following values:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `docs_versioning=None` disables versioning.\n",
    "2. `docs_versioning=minor` deploys document in `<major>.<minor>` format and reads the version from the `settings.ini` file. Newer patch versions will replace previous minor versions (e.g. 1.0.1 replaces 1.0 and becomes the new 1.0 version).\n",
    "3. `docs_versioning=patch` deploys document in `<major>.<minor>.<patch>` format (e.g. 1.0.0, 1.0.1) and reads the version from the settings.ini file.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend setting `docs_versioning=minor` to limit the number of deployments while keeping all patch version changes. This also helps to keep your Git repository small.\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! note\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Regardless of whether `docs_versioning` is set to `minor` or `patch`, the documentation for the pre-release versions such as `1.0.0rc0` or `1.0.0dev` will be deployed as-is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Push the change to Git and wait for the `pages build and deployment` GitHub action to complete. After that, view the project documentation URL to see the latest changes. To access different versions, use the version selector in the header (a reference screenshot is provided below).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/doc_versioning.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you visit older or pre-release versions of the documentation, you'll see a friendly warning in the header like below. Clicking on `Click here to go to latest` link will redirect you to the latest version.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/doc_versioning_version_warning.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! note\n",
    "\n",
    "    If you enable documentation versioning for the first time and deploy a pre-release candidate version, the version warning will appear in the header since there are no prior stable versions. To resolve this, please set the `default` flag to `dev` in the `mkdocs/mkdocs.yml` file like below.\n",
