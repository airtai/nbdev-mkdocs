**nbdev_mkdocs** is a nbdev extension that allows you to generate
documentation from notebooks using Material for Mkdocs instead of
Quarto.

## Quick start

The following quick start guide will walk you through installing and
configuring nbdev_mkdocs for an existing nbdev project. It also assumes
you’ve already initialized your project with nbdev and installed all of
the required libraries.

For detailed installation instructions, configuration options, and an
End-To-End Walkthrough, please see the
[documentation](https://nbdev-mkdocs.airt.ai/).

nbdev_mkdocs is published as a Python package and can be installed with
pip:

``` shell
pip install nbdev_mkdocs
```

Note that `nbdev_mkdocs` must be installed into the same Python
environment that you used to install nbdev.

If the installation was successful, you should now have the
**nbdev_mkdocs** installed on your system. Run the below command from
the terminal to see the full list of available commands:

``` shell
nbdev_mkdocs --help
```

                                                                                    
     Usage: nbdev_mkdocs [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

### Setup

After installing nbdev_mkdocs, bootstrap your project documentation by
executing the following command from the project’s root directory:

``` python
nbdev_mkdocs new
```

Using information from the project’s settings.ini file, the above
command creates files and directories required to build the
documentation and saves it in the **mkdocs** subdirectory.

### Build and prepare

If you haven’t already, please run the following commands from the
project’s root directory to generate and install Python modules from the
notebooks locally:

``` python
nbdev_export && pip install '.[dev]'
```

To build the documentation, execute the following command from the
project’s root directory:

``` python
nbdev_mkdocs prepare
```

Running the above command will:

- Generate the markdown files from the notebooks and saves them to the
  **mkdocs/docs/** directory.
- Builds the documentation from the generated markdown files and saves
  the resulting files to the **mkdocs/site** directory.

### Preview

After the documentation has been successfully built, run the following
command to start a local server and preview the documentation.

``` python
nbdev_mkdocs preview
```
